# Exercises

This folder should contain all the exercises notebooks resolved as part of the course individual assignments (Portefolio).  
The exercises resolutions that are part of a file in the repository should be found in their specific file/folder/location.  
For example, the exercise solution for 'Add a method to the Dataset class that removes all samples containing at least one null value (NaN)' should be found where the dataset class is defined.

# Exercises

This folder should contain all the exercises notebooks resolved as part of the course individual assignments (Portefolio).
The exercises that are part of a file in the repository should be found in their specific folder/location. 
For example, the exercise 'Add a method to the Dataset class that removes all samples containing at least one null value (NaN).' should be found where the dataset class is defined.
